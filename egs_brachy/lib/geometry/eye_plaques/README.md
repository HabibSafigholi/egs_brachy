CLRP Eye Plaque Database version 2 (CLRP_EPv2) of egs_brachy models for photon-emitting sources



This repository contains geometry model files for 8 COMS, 5 BEBIG, and 4 Representative models for Pd-103, I-125, and Cs-131 seeds described and validated in the CLRP_EPv2 database. 
The models are to be used with the open-source Monte Carlo code egs_brachy which is an EGSnrc application available at https://github.com/clrp-code/egs_brachy.
The CLRP-TG43v2 database is hosted at a Carleton University website: https://physics.carleton.ca/clrp/eye_plaque_v2 with DOI http://doi.org/10.22215/clrp/EPv2.
